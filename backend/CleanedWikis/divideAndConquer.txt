Divide And Conquer 
This technique can be divided into the following three parts:

Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.

Advantages of Divide and Conquer Algorithm:

The difficult problem can be solved easily.
It divides the entire problem into subproblems thus it can be solved parallelly ensuring multiprocessing
Efficiently uses cache memory without occupying much space
Reduces time complexity of the problem

Disadvantages of Divide and Conquer Algorithm:

It involves recursion which is sometimes slow
Efficiency depends on the implementation of logic
It may crash the system if the recursion is performed rigorously
